* This homework assignment was pre-built for the student to better learn how to read and understand what we've learned in the last couple of classes. The purpose was to make changes to the code so that the code was easier to navigate and read. Changes that were made can be found in the pull requests but also can be found in the Styles.CSS as chunks were commented out for the grader to understand what was updated.
